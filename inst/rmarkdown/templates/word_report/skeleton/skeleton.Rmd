# Background

**Outline the study schema/schedule, study groups, time points, etc. Here**

*Example Description*

Bladder Cancer Project looking at patients receiving neoadjuvant gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC), focusing on
number of cycles (3 vs. 4)

# Objectives

**List report objectives Here**

*Example Description:*

- For the patients receiving neoadjuvant gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC), is 3 or 4 cycles better.

# Endpoints

**List report Endpoints Here**

*Example Description:*

- Downstaged to pT0N0 (No/Yes)
    - Did the patient have complete response?
- Overall Survival
    - Survival time from date of surgery to date of death or last follow-up


# Methods


## Patient Eligibility

**Define Subgroup Here**

*Example Description:*

Patients receiving neoadjuvant gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) chemo.

## Statistical Methods

**Explain Statistical Methods Used Here**

*Example Description:*

Patient characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics including median and range for continuous measures and proportions and frequencies for categorical measures. When comparing characteristics to histology the median and $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles are shown for continuous variables. The association between continuous variables and histology were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests. The associations between categorical variables and three endpoints were evaluated using Chi-squared tests or Fisher’s exact tests when the expected frequencies is less than 5 in some cell. Categorical variable levels for overall survival will be compared using the Log-rank test.

Logistic regression models were fit for the endpoints Downstaged to pT0N0 (No/Yes), and Cox Proportional Hazard models were fit for overall survival. Unadjusted and adjusted (multivariable) models were run for Histology and relevant covariates. Odds ratios (or Hazard ratios for Cox models), with 95% confidence intervals, and p values are presented. For categorical variables with more than two levels, p values are presented for each level compared to a referent level, and also an overall p value using the type-III analysis-of-variance result for the respective model.

For cancer specific survival, deaths were only treated as events when the cause of death was confirmed to be due to the related cancer.

Due to the exploratory nature of this analysis p-values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

### Graphical Methods

**Explanation of what plots/figures were created**

*Example Description:*

Distributions of continuous factors will be plotted for each outcome value, with box plots superimposed on the distributions. The mid-line of the box denotes the median and the ends of the box denote the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. The whiskers denote the most extreme data points that are no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box). 

Kaplan–Meier curves will be drawn for overall survival comparing selected categorical variables, along with number at risk along the x-axis.

# Results

## Participant Cohort

**Include sample sizes and other relevant cohort info here Here**

*Example Description:*

There are a total `r n_samp` patients in this analysis. Table \@ref(tab:Overall-Table) show the descriptive statistics for all factors, with median and range for continuous measures and proportions and frequencies for categorical measures. 

There were `r sum(Analytical_Data$Clinical_Stage == 'Stage I (<=T1NxMx)')` patients that were Stage I ($\le T1NxMx$), but for the purposes of the analysis will be combined with the Stage II ($T2NxMx$) patients. 

## Number of Cycles (3 vs. 4) [Variable of Interest Results Here]

**Description of Variable of Interest Results Here**

*Table \@ref(tab:Variable-of-Interest-Table) is an example of a table comparing a binary variable to multiple variables*

*Figure \@ref(fig:ElixSumplots) is an example of a figure comparing a categorical variable to continuous variable (Boxplot)*

*Example Description (Note text here using in-line r chunks for dynamic updating of statistics and p values):*

Table \@ref(tab:Variable-of-Interest-Table) shows the descriptive statistics for all factors by number of cycles (3 vs. 4), with median and $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles for continuous measures and proportions and frequencies for categorical measures. Overall tests were performed, as well as pairwise comparisons between the three number of cycles levels.

There were no significant differences between any factors and number of cycles, although the sum of Elixhauser Comorbidities differences across the number of cycles was near significant , with a median of `r paste0(cycles_compare[['Sum of Elixhauser Comorbidities']]$descriptive[-1,'med'], collapse = ' and ')` Elixhauser Comorbidities for `r paste0(cycle_levels, collapse = ' and ')` number of cycles, respectively (`r MoffittFunctions::pretty_pvalues(cycles_compare[['Sum of Elixhauser Comorbidities']]$p.overall, include_p = TRUE, digits = 4)`). Figure \@ref(fig:ElixSumplots) shows the relationship between Sum of Elixhauser Comorbidities and the number of cycles.
